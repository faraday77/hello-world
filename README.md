##### Hello World!

This is an odd respository. As you can see, there seems to be no important pieces of code and projects lying about this repository and there is a reason for this. This is the first repository I made and as such it is only going to be used for learning purposes or whenever I want to test out an interesting feature of Github that I've discovered on the Internet. I am currently learning programming and cybersecurity on my own so this repository will get quite busy in the near future. Feel free to peruse the branches and folders of this repository, but do take note that there will be nothing interesting (at least I think) that will be found from this corner of my web. Unless you simply want to peruse through this repository for your own personal amusement, then who am I to dissuade you from doing so? You are clearly a functional human being and as such I have no right to command or force you to do something else outside of your free will. Farewell, human being, and have a nice day.
